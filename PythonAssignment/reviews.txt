What an awesome cookbook!! My only quibble is that for some reason the recipe headers are in the left margins which become more and more invisible the further you go into the book.

Really enjoying AMA and have so many dishes I still want to try out. Picture of the ceviche and Cha Cha snapper which were two great dishes. I have quite a few tex-mex cookbooks but this is by far my favourite

I have another book from the author, and much like that book, this one is full of creative approaches to great flavor.
My family and I have cooked a few dozen recipes out of the book now and each and every one of the recipes has been great. Are the recipes easy to follow? Yes! not something I can say about all cookbooks. This is a must have in my collection.

I love this book. I have to say that I was a little skeptical of a Tex-Mex recipe book but having enjoyed his BÃ¤co cookbook and his instagram account I decided to buy it. I am so glad I did. The food is not the greasy salty cheesy food one associates with Tex-Mex food. The recipes remind me so much of Northern Mexico food with a gourmet and more flavorful twist. Everything I have made from this book has been fantastic. I always have in my fridge the pickled habaneros and the preserved kumquats and I make another batch before I run out. The flour tortilla recipe is different from any I had seen because it calls for milk but these are the softest flour tortillas I have ever had. Wonderful book.

Wow.. what a fantastic book! After a somewhat hard to approach, but the amazing first book, Baco,.. Ama is incredibly accessible to most cooks. All of the recipes I have tried so far have been amazing! It was also a featured book in a cookbook club, and it was one of the most popular books of all time! If I had one small nitpick.. it that the actual book is a bit taller than some others so that can make it not fit on certain shelves of mine.

Highly Recommended!
